#### _Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I have converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. This webpage has been improved from a static design that lacks accessibility to a responsive design on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users has been added.

### Specification

Responsive on most display screens. Includes standard accessibility features, and it works offline.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
